# Continuous Assessment 2 - MERN Development 


## Installation

Using git clone in the command line or download using a zip, install this project onto you local machine.
When downloaded use "npm install" to install the node_modules which will be needed for running the site. 
Once it has installed use "npm run dev" to run the local server to view the project.

## Database

For MongoDB there is two files added books.json and users.json. This has the data for the two collections in the REACTCA2 database. This is incase 
there is nothing viewing on the website. Using Robo3t or MongoCompass create a database called REACTCA2 and add the two collections in and copy over the code.
